hii every one today is the first day in field of linux.
we will be seeing how to install linus based OS(OPERATING SYSTEM) in our desktop.
There are more than 600 OS, among them 3 are popular
1)Windows OS--(Home based, not so programmer friendly )
2)MAC OS-- (for mac user)
3)Linux--(Home based, programmer friendly)

see about MINIX(first linux),SCO UNIX, *nix
AIX--IBM
UX--HP

2 categories
1)Debian--kali,ubuntu
2)Posix--Fedora,Red hat,centOS


Cent OS(simillar to red hat but all will be free)

There are some online platform to get certification on linux
if you have one OS running in your device and want one more OS the you can use VM(virtual machine) in your device.
you can use VMWARE, VirtualBOX by oracle. for installing in device(working without internet after installation)
You can use online cloud from aws,google(debit-card),allibaba(paytm) for paying for our usage(it require internet for working).

90% commands will be same in all linux distribution and remaining 10% are different which make all linux OS distinct(different).
I will be using Ubuntu at present, if any problems are faced in my journey of learning linux then i will be using CentOS.
